# Morpho-semantic Components for Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation

Identifying the correct meaning of words in context or discovering new word senses is particularly useful for several tasks such as question answering, information extraction, information retrieval, and text summarization. We propose an approach to induce and disambiguate word senses of some target words in collections of short texts, such as tweets, through the use of fuzzy lexico-semantic patterns that we define as sequences of Morpho-semantic Components (MSC).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Citing
If you use any code or sources from MSC patterns in your research work, you are kindly asked to acknowledge the use of the tool in your publications.
