# Morpho-semantic Components for Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation

Identifying the correct meaning of words in context or discovering new word senses is particularly useful for several tasks such as question answering, information extraction, information retrieval, and text summarization. We propose an approach to induce and disambiguate word senses of some target words in collections of short texts, such as tweets, through the use of fuzzy lexico-semantic patterns that we define as sequences of Morpho-semantic Components (MSC).
